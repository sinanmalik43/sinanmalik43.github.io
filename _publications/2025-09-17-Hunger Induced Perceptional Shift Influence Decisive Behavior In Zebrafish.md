Behavioral plasticity arises from a dynamic interplay between an organism’s metabolic state and external cues. Effective decision-making requires flexibility to weigh potential costs and benefits for survival. In zebrafish, hunger heightens the perception of small black dots as prey, increasing approach frequency compared to well-fed individuals. When presented simultaneously with prey-like dots and a sympatric predator, normally fed fish avoid both stimuli, whereas hungry fish take greater risks by approaching the dots despite nearby predatory cues. This shift reflects a hunger-induced recalibration of predatory–prey perception that favors nutritional gain over safety. Thus, metabolic state can pivot zebrafish behavior from avoidance to active pursuit in the face of conflicting survival demands.
