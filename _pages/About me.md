About me
===

I am Sinan Malik, and I recently completed my master’s degree in Biology from Periyar University, Salem, India . I am currently a research intern in Dr. Binu’s Neuronal Plasticity Group, where I explore behavioral plasticity and examine the learning processes of larval zebrafish. I am passionate about the neuronal mechanisms underlying visually guided behavior and multisensory integration, aiming to understand how neuronal circuits integrate sensory inputs and internal state and convert this information into behavioral responses.
