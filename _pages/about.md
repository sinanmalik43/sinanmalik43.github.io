About me
------
I am Sinan Malik, and I recently completed my master's degree in Biology from Periyar University, Salem, India . I am currently a research intern in Dr. Binu's Neuronal Plasticity Group, where I explore behavioral plasticity and examine the learning processes of larval zebrafish. I am passionate about the neuronal, molecular, and circuit mechanisms underlying decision-making, multisensory integration, and information processing, including how this information is represented, transformed, and influenced by internal bodily states to regulate both conscious and instinctive behavior.
